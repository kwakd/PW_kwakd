          <h3>necessary games studio experience</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          I collaborated with a developer and his studio to recreate and port
          several of his games from Flashpunk (which had become deprecated) to
          HTML5 using GameMaker Studio 2. Over the course of a year, I gained
          valuable experience in the full game development process, including
          participating in regular meetings, conducting peer reviews, and
          handling bug fixes. This hands-on involvement significantly deepened
          my understanding of both technical workflows and team collaboration in
          a professional setting.

          <h3>Walking With Magnus</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          This was another game poem with strong symbolic elements, built as a
          walking simulator with more interactive input compared to the previous
          title. The game emphasizes atmospheric storytelling through its
          scenery and sound design. I helped port it from FlashPunk to HTML5
          using GameMaker Studio 2, further honing my skills in adapting legacy
          projects while preserving their artistic intent.

        </div>
        <p>
          I worked with a partner on porting <i>"Walk-or-Die"</i>, a unique
          walking simulator described by its creator as ‚Äúmore poem than game.‚Äù
          The project focused on preserving the artistic intent while adapting
          the game to GameMaker Studio 2. Through this experience, I gained a
          deeper understanding of the engine and its capabilities, especially in
          handling unconventional game mechanics and narrative-driven design.
