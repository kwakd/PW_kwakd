          I'm a Junior Game Designer and Developer with a little under two years
          of experience in the video game industry. I began as a competitive
          player in platformer fighters, auto-chess, and more recently, 2D
          fighting games. Over time, my focus has shifted toward the creative
          and technical aspects of game developmentâ€”especially in designing
          systems and mechanics that support engaging and well-balanced
          gameplay.
