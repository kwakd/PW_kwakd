          This was one of my more successful projects, earning 3rd place in a
          Game Jam. The main area for improvement was the visual consistency, as
          I relied on various free assets found online, which didnâ€™t blend
          seamlessly. Despite that, the game design was solidâ€”something
          reflected in the final placement and feedback received.
        </p>
        <p>
          Originally, I set out to create an auto-runner with idle-game
          elements, where the character would run continuously without player
          input. During development, I ran into challenges getting the character
          to run autonomously. However, this led to an unexpected pivot: the
          auto-run mechanic evolved into a boost feature instead. This change
          ended up enhancing the gameplay by introducing a skill-based element,
          giving players more control and raising the skill ceiling in a
          meaningful way.
        </p>
        <p>
          The future goal for this project is to develop it into a multiplayer
          browser-based game. I see this as a great opportunity to explore
          multiplayer game development and gain experience with networking
          concepts. It would not only expand the game's potential audience but
          also serve as a strong introduction for me into the world of online
          multiplayer systems.
