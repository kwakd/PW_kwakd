          <h3>Asgards Wrath 2 - [Sanzaru Games]</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          Asgardâ€™s Wrath 2 was not only my first role in the QA field but also
          my first introduction to virtual reality development. Stepping into
          the world of VR testing was both challenging and exciting, as it
          required a strong eye for immersive design, spatial interactions, and
          user comfort. Within just two months, I became one of the top five bug
          reporters on the team, consistently identifying critical issues and
          edge cases. I also quickly developed the ability to write clear,
          concise, and actionable bug reports and tickets, which helped
          facilitate efficient communication between QA, developers, and
          designers. This experience sharpened my attention to detail, taught me
          how to navigate complex VR systems, and emphasized the importance of
          clarity and collaboration in a fast-paced development environment.

        <p>
          I currently work at Experis as a Test Associate II, where I support
          large-scale projects for high-profile clients. In this role, Iâ€™ve
          contributed to a wide range of testing efforts, from exploratory
          testing to detailed bug investigations and documentation. In April
          2025, I was honored to be named Tester of the Month, a recognition of
          my consistent performance, attention to detail, and collaborative
          approach. One of my key strengths has been creating clear and
          effective documentation, which has proven valuable to engineers across
          various teams as a reliable reference for debugging and development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Working at Experis has given me the opportunity to engage with
          enterprise-level workflows and understand the quality standards
          expected at the top of the industry. Iâ€™ve also developed strong
          communication and collaboration skills, regularly working alongside
          cross-functional teams to ensure issues are identified, documented,
          and resolved efficiently. This experience has further solidified my
          passion for QA and strengthened my ability to contribute meaningfully
          to complex development pipelines.
