        <b>About <i>GLHF-Fishing Game (Unity)</i></b>
      </p>
      <p>
        A game inspired by the idle-game category at the time. <br />My main
        vision for this project was a game you'd put on the background, and when
        you heard a little ping that's when you'd know you caught a fish.
        <br />You'd quickly go back to the game and press the correct sequence
        of buttons to reel the fish in. The goal was to simulate a more
        realistic fishing experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately people didn't understand the initial concept of it and
        this was recieved poorly because people thought it was a a very-active
        game. When it was actually the opposite.
        <br />Which taught me how I need to make these game explanations a lot
        more clearer, as looking back I can definiltey understand their
        perspective.
      </p>

        - THERE IS NO SAVE STATE FOR THIS GAME
        <br />
        - Game can only be played on 760px or wider

      <p>
        I'm a Junior Game Designer and Developer with over two years of
        experience in the video game industry. My journey began as a competitive
        player in platformer fighters, auto-chess, and more recently, 2D
        fighting games. Over time, my focus has evolved toward the creative and
        technical aspects of developmentâ€”particularly in designing game systems
        and mechanics that deliver engaging, balanced gameplay experiences. I'm
        currently expanding my skills with the goal of creating a 3D platformer,
        with a strong emphasis on fluid movement and responsive controls.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, Iâ€™m expanding my skill set by learning 3D modeling with
        the goal of producing custom resin figures. Inspired by vinyl figure
        artists who design and produce their own collectibles, it has long been
        a personal ambition to create a system where people can collect both a
        physical figure and a corresponding digital asset. By combining what I'm
        learning in Unity, Blender, and JavaScript, I'm actively working toward
        building a prototype to bring this concept to life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Iâ€™m currently working as a Test Associate II at
        <strong>Experis</strong>, where Iâ€™m assigned to <strong>META</strong> as
        a client. Iâ€™m part of the team supporting the
        <strong>Horizon Worlds</strong> project, contributing to quality
        assurance and testing efforts to ensure a seamless user experience.
